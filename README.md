# MSI Keyboard Typing Speed

### Hello and welcome to my first web application "MSI Keyboard Typing Speed" üôè

This Project was made for IEEE AAST Alexandria Student Branch's Keyboard Typing Speed Contest

#### Used by nearly 100 people in the university

## Modes: 

- Practice Mode :
  - A 60-second trial for trying out the game and getting ready for the competition.
- Competitive Mode :
  - This is where the fun begins, you enter a round with 7 trials and compete against the others reach the highest score.

## Features:

- Words Per Minute :
  - When the game ends, the number of words per miunte is calculated and shown to the user on the screen before moving to the second trial.

- Character Per Minute :
  - When the game ends, the number of characters per miunte is calculated and shown to the user on the screen before moving to the second trial.

- Leaderboards :
  - The score and the data of the user (Name, Email, Number, etc.) are stored in a Google Sheet which makes it easier for all the IEEE volunteers to edit and grab any data they need for the future.

## Upcoming Features:

- Accuracy
- Leaderboards on-site

If you have any ideas or features to be added or encounter problems with the web app, don't hesitate to contact me privately :
